# Hello-World

Hello this is Jerry Moua. I came from csci 4 with April. I have a really basic understanding of coding and hopefully after this class I have expand my understanding of code. I like to read on my free time. I am not a social person and it does take me a while to get used to others but it doesn't mean that I do not want to interact with them. Most of the Time I just don't know how to interact. I hope to be able to get to know some of my class mate and have a great semester.
